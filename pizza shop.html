                            <h3>Pizza shop</h3>
    <p> Pizza is the greatest cuisine in the world and my favorite food. I’d like to believe a majority of the world has had a pizza in some way or form. First, let’s focus on the taste. Depending on the toppings you choose, pizza can differentiate for everyone. It can be spicy if you add jalapenos, or choose to spread some red peppers over it. It’s hot, and succulent at the same time. It’s truly a wonderful taste when you take that first bite, and al the flavors of the sauce, cheese, and seasoning go rushing towards your taste buds. Second thing, the sound pizza makes</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pizza shop at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
